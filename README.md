Animated Materials for Unity

This script is for animating materials in Unity. Just drag and drop the script into a GameObject. Then drag and drop all Textures you want to use in the "sprites" array. Set the "updatetime" to something like 10 (it would update once every second aka. 1FPS) and you'll see it updating.
